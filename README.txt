!!!NOTE TO GRADER!!!
--I was unable to implement tkinter module into my project
--as I needed a dynamicly updating window each frame
--tkinter was not cooperating, anytime I tried using a looping
--structure with the structure of a gui component, it would
--not work. I decided to cut my losses and implement everything
--that would've been included in the gui in a terminal based program
--it is not as aesthetically pleasing but it is the same code logic


TO RUN:
Ensure the latest installment of python 3
the runner.py file requires cell.py, do not separate these in the directory

DESCRIPTION: 
Run runner.py to begin Random Cell Simulation. 
User will be prompted to continue or terminate
when continuing, user will enter parameter size of world, n, and will watch in real time
as a cell randomly tries to navigate an unknown terrain to find fruit so that it may continue
to live. Once found, program will prompt user if they want to restart, if not, terminate.
